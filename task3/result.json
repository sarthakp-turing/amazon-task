Based on our HR policies, department managers typically need to have roles such as \"hiring_manager\" or higher authority levels.\n\nBefore we can proceed with assigning Laura as the Operations Department manager, we would need to:\n1. Update her role to an appropriate managerial role\n2. Get proper approval for this role change\n\nWould you like me to help with updating Laura's role first? If so, what role would you like to assign to her? The options that would be appropriate for a department manager include:\n- hiring_manager\n- hr_manager\n- hr_director\n- finance_officer\n\nOr would you prefer to assign someone else who already has an appropriate role as the Operations Department manager?"
